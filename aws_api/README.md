# AWS_API- pure python solution to AWS API automation.


Features:
* S3 parallel uploading.
* Hardcoded protections - tag enforcement, IAM entities PATH enforcement. Deleting all Security group rules without explicit permission - prohibited. etc.
* Automate basic flows - ACM certificate registration, Status waiters on provisioning and deletions etc.
* As well many different tools I've implemented rely on AWSAPI - Serverless alert system, security analyzer, AWS cleaning, deployers etc.
