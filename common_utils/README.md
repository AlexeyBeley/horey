# Basic utils 

##Concepts:
* No Horey packages can be used in requirements.txt!
* Try to make the utils as simple as possible to eliminate the need in logger.
* If logger is needed (working with IO for example) - must be passed explicitly from outside.
* This is in order to make use of these utils in development process itself- packaging/building/testing etc.


##Action Manager:
